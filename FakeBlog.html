    <title>How many blogs can Abbey start?</title>

    <a href=http://www.mountainwifey.com>Here's the most recent un-kempt attempt</a>
    <p>Throughout her many years of writing, Abbey has attempted to make herself write a blog countless times. Today, we're generating one from scratch, which means we probably still won't see this goddamn thing come to fruition. She's in coding school now, and that means she's got higher standards for what this should look like than her skils will currently accommodate.</p>
